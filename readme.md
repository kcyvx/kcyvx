###### I am comfortable working with modern front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js, and I enjoy building responsive user interfaces using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. On the backend, I use Firebase to manage authentication, databases, and hosting.
###### I primarily code in JavaScript and TypeScript, but I also have experience with Python for scripts and backend logic. I build, deploy, and optimize applications using tools like Vite, Nginx, Docker, and Node.js.
###### Iâ€™m always looking to learn and expand my stack with tools that improve performance, maintainability, and scalability.
